Connect 4.0 README:

	By Jay Mishra and Ryan Xia, 5/16/17



Description:



	This is a variation of the classic game Connect 4. The objective is the same as the original game (players try to get four tiles in a row of their color), but with some added twists. Each turn, players can choose to either place a tile on the rack or shift the tiles to the right or left of the board. Tiles stack on top of each other. Additional powers include the ability to delete entire rows or columns after certain numbers of turns. These added features make the ultimate goal of getting four in a row more challenging and fun!



Instructions:



	-Players click on the start button on the home screen after reading the instructions.

	-When it is a player’s turn, they click on the column that they would like to drop their tile into.

	-Players may use the left arrow key to turn the board 90˚ to the left. (NOT DONE)

	-Players may use the right arrow key to turn the board 90˚. Players may not drop a tile and rotate the board on the same turn. (NOT DONE)

	-The first player to get four in a row of their color wins.

Responsibility list:

	-Ryan: Tile, Improved the graphical portion of the game by adding a feature that allows players to add tiles using the mouse instead of forcing them to use the keyboard. Made it so that columns become highlighted in gray when a player mouses over them. Added a rough version of a feature that allows players to move tiles to different sides of the board.
